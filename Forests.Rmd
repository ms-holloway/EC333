# Tree Facts

There are over 60,000 species of trees in the world

<br>

Depending on the species, a tree can produce 260 pounds of oxygen in a year

<br>

20% of the world's oxygen is produced in the Amazon Rainforest

<br>

An acre of trees can remove 2.6 *tons* of CO2 in a year

<br> 

Trees help mitigate climate change by absorbing CO2 and also help with climate adaptation by locally cooling by up to 20 degrees

# Efficient?

One way (of many) to view trees is as capital for current and future generations

<br>

They are a finite resource that has the potential to regrow (like fish)

<br>

If we want people in the future to be able to benefit from trees, while still benefitting ourselves, we need to harvest in a way that doesn't affect their ability to grow back

<br>

We need to be **efficient** in our harvest relative to a function that takes future humans into account

---

# Harvest

.bigger[

It can be thought of as 'costly' to leave trees standing - the goal is to find *when* the relative benefit of harvesting them is at its highest

<br> 

The goal of an efficient harvest problem is to identify the **length of time to wait** between timber harvests that maximizes the difference between total benefits and total costs

<br>

Appropriately forward thinking models will consider the benefit to future society in this calculation

# Harvest time considerations

Dynamic models of human behavior and resource growth can get complicated fast

<br>

We can't capture all the nuances at once, so just keep in mind

  1. .green[**Forests have value outside of timber**]
  
    - Our simple model will only directly think of the benefit from commercial timber extraction
 <br>
 
  2. .pink[**Forest lands have a wide variety of property rights**]
  
    - We'll have to pick out one at a time to focus on

# Biological rotation

.bigger[
Assume trees in a forest are homogenous (all exactly the same)

<br>

We can then measure the growth of the forest (or tree farm) as a function of time

<br>

Say that volume of trees follows $V(t) = 10t + t^2 - 0.01t^3$

]

---

# Biological rotation

$V(t) = 10t + t^2 - 0.01t^3$

```{r, fig.retina = 1, echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("growth.png")
```

---

# Calculus Time

To find the point where the maximum (or minimum) of a function occurs, we can take the *first derivative of the function*, set it equal to 0, and solve for $t$ in our case - We're finding where growth of the function = 0

<br>

$V(t) = 10t + t^2 - 0.01t^3$

--
<br>

$V'(t) = 10 + 2t - 0.03t^2$

$V'(t) = 10 + 2t - 0.03t^2 = 0$

--

$V'(t) = 0$ at $t \approx 71$

<br>

So the forest grows for 71 years before beginning to shrink

---

# Calculus Time

To find the point where growth *slows down* we need to take the *second derivative* set = 0, and solve for $t$ - We're  finding where the rate of change of growth is equal to 0

<br>

$V'(t) = 10 + 2t - 0.03t^2$

--

<br>
 
$V''(t) = 2 -0.06t$

$V''(t) = 2 -0.06t = 0$

--

$V''(t) = 0$ at $t \approx 33$

<br>

So the forest grows less than it did last year starting at year 33

---

# When to Harvest 

If growth slows at 33 years and growth stops at 71 years, when is the best time to harvest?

<br>

One .pink[harvest interval] is to let the forest grow for 71 years to maximize *volume* of harvest

<br>

A slightly more sophisticated option is to cut trees when .blue[**mean annual increment (MAI) is maximized]

<br>

$MAI = \frac{V(t)}{t}$, the average volume of the forest up to that year

<br>

Maximizing MAI as our harvest rule takes time into account and still maximizes some notion of tree volume

---

# Biological Rotation

.pull-left[

Harvesting according to maximizing MAI is called the .green[*biological rotation]

<br>

In our case $\frac{V(t)}{t} = 10 +t -0.01t^2$

<br>

MAI is maximized at 50 years

# Biological Rotation

.bigger[
Biological rotation maximizes timber volume over years, but that's all it maximizes

<br>

It does not consider the benefits or costs to society of that volume

<br>

We need to consider more in our analysis

.biggest[Wicksell Rotation]

---

# Wicksell Rotation

.bigger[

As a forest owner, one has to consider when the benefit of cutting outweigh the benefit of letting the tree continue to grow

<br>

The owner needs to compare the **net returns of cutting the trees this year to the net returns of waiting one more year**

]

---

# Wicksell Rotation

The .orange[Wicksell Rotation] focuses on when a *single harvest* most benefits a *private landowner*

<br>

With this simplification, it allows us to complicate the model in another way

<br>

It introduces the concept of time value of money into the optimal harvest decision

<br>

The owner considers the .red[**discount rate**]: the .underline[expected rate of return] for and investment, .green[**r**]

---

# Wicksell Rotation

The general rule for optimal harvesting in this context is to compare the net benefits of cutting this year to cutting next year

<br>

  - Don't Cut  if  $MNB_0 < MNB_1$
  
  - Cut        if  $MNB_0 = MNB_1$
  
  
<br>

If $MNB_0 > MNB_1$, you've technically missed your optimal harvest

---

# Wicksell Rotation

As a forest owner, what are the cost and benefit involved in the decision?

--

<br>


They can sell the timber at price $p$

It costs them $c$ to harvest each unit

They harvest every unit in the forest in that period - $V(T_0)$

--

<br>

$MNB_0 = (p-c)V(T_0)$

---

# Wicksell Rotation

How do we account for value in future periods?

--

We have to weight future value by the discount rate, $r$

<br>

--

$MNB_1 = \frac{(p-c)V(T_1)}{(1+r)}$

The larger $r$ is, the less we value future benefits

---

# Wicksell Rotation

Remember we want to find where $MNB_0 = MNB_1$

<br>

$MNB_0 = (p-c)V(T_0) =  \frac{(p-c)V(T_1)}{(1+r)} = MNB_1$

Assume price and cost stay fixed

--

$V(T_0) = \frac{(p-c)V(T_1)}{(1+r)}$

$V(T_0))(1+r) = V(T_1)$

$V(T_0) + V(T_0)r = V(T_1)$

--

<br>

$r = \frac{V(T_1)-V(T_0)}{V(T_0)}$ or $\frac{\Delta V}{V(T_0)}$

---

# Wicksell Rotation

$\frac{V(T_1)-V(T_0)}{V(T_0)}$ is the percent change in forest volume - Can also call this the *return to the capital asset* from not touching it for a year

<br>

Optimal harvest occurs when the percentage increase in the asset exactly equals the rate we discount future benefit at

<br>

We want growth to be just offset by how much we care about future value

<br>

A higher interest rate implies a shorter rotation - harvesting when the forest is still growing at a higher rate

# Wicksell Rotation

.pull-left[

```{r, fig.retina = 1, echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("growth.png")
```

]

.pull-right[

The longer growth rate is increasing, the longer we wait to harvest

<br>

In this example, as long as $ r> 0.02$, the Wicksell rotation is shorter than the *biological rotation*

<br>

It would not be optimal to the owner to maximize volume

.biggest[Faustmann Rotation]

# Faustmann Rotation

.pink[Biological Rotation] tells us to maximize average tree volume


<br>

.orange[Wicksell Rotation] takes into account the time value of money

<br>

The .blue[Faustmann Rotation] adds two more real world items to think of

  1. The **Site Value**, $S$ of the forested piece of land
  
  2. The **Cost of Replanting**, $D$, after a harvest
  
---

# Faustmann Rotation

The Faustmann Rotation not only when to harvest, but also **alternative land use**

<br>

Each year, the land owner has multiple choices:

  1. Cut and replant
  
  2. Wait, then cut and replant
  
  3. Cut and change land use
  
  4. Wait, cut and change land use
  
---

# Site Value

Site value is equal to the value of the land used in its most profitable way - what you could sell it for or make off the land if it weren't forest

<br> 

If forestry is the most profitable land use, $S$ is the value of land as timber harvest, but if it would be more valuable as different kind of farm or land for housing, $S$ will reflect one of those

<br>

The site value is equal to the *present value of expected future revenue* from the land in its most profitable use

<br>

Think of the discount rate - $110 next year is worth only $100 to you now

<br>

Adding $S$ to the model allows us to think of the *opportunity cost* of using the land for forestry

---

# Faustmann Optimal Harvest

Our rule is similar to Wicksell Rotation - with just a few complications

<br>

Cut and replant when $MNB_{cut,0} = MNB_{cut,1}$

<br>

But these benefits now must take into account $D$ - the cost of starting over - and $S$ - what we could sell the land for this period

--

$MNB_{cut,0} = (p-c)V(T_0)-D+S$

$MNB_{cut,1} = \frac{(p-c)[V(T_0)+ \Delta V]-D+S}{1+r}$

---

# Faustmann Optimal Harvest

We know $(p-c)$ is going to wash out, so lets simplify the equation

<br>

--

$V(T_0)-D+S = \frac{(V(T_0)+ \Delta V)-D+S}{1+r}$


--

$(V(T_0)-D+S)(1+r) = (V(T_0)+ \Delta V)-D+S$

$V(T_0) + rV(T_0) - D + S -rD +rS =(V(T_0)+ \Delta V)-D+S$

--

<br>

$r(V(T_0) - D) + rS = \Delta V$

--

The LHS is the benefit of harvesting NOW. The RHS is the cost(forgone value of timber) from harvesting now

]


.pull-right[

We can graph the cost and benefit - where the curves cross is the $T*$ when we should harvest

<br>

Intitially tree growth out paces the marginal benefit of harvest

<br>

But as growth slows down, eventually the benefit of harvesting catches up

]

---

# Faustmann Optimal Harvest

We can look at this condition the same we did Wicksell, by putting $r$ by itself

$r = \frac{\Delta V}{V(T_0) - D + S}$

<br>

The land owner should time harvest so that her rate of return on the asset is equal to her discount rate

<br>

The only difference between this and Wicksell is that the value of the land and cost of upkeep is also being taken into account

---

# Faustmann Optimal Harvest

Compared to the biological and Wicksell Rotations, Faustmann is mechanically shorter than both:

$T_B > T_W > T_F$

<br>

Given reasonable assumptions on the discount rate, Wicksell is shorter than the biological

<br>

Faustmann forces the rotation to be shorter by including $D$ and $S$

$\frac{\Delta V}{V(T_0) - D + S} > \frac{\Delta V}{V(T_0)}$

Assuming $S - D$ is positive (would it make sense for this not to be the case?)

--

Since this means a higher $r$ under Faustmann, we get a shorter rotation(harvesting when growth rate is higher)

.biggest[Non-timber Benefits]

# Non-timber benefits

Of course forests have values outside of timber harvesting

Forests bring value through:

  - Acting as recreational areas
  
  - Providing Oxygen
  
  - Acting as natural filtration for water 
  
  - Promoting biodiversity
  
  - Having incalculable intrinsic value
  
---

# Non-timber benefits

.bigger[
To go along with these benefits, there are costs beyond the profit margin when it comes to harvesting trees

Old Growth forests are forests that have stood long enough to promote ecosystems within themselves

By removing these, we are removing habitats for animals and other organisms - potentially driving them to extinction

Consider adding $H$, the losses involved with harvesting, to our Faustmann problem

This moves the curve upwards ,meaning intersection will occur at a later $T*$

Depending on the value of $H$, it's possible that the value is so high that T* may be infinite(it's never optimal to cut down the trees)

]

---

# Property Rights

Forests may be public goods (National Parks) or open-access resources(timber harvests)

<br>

The open-access equilibrium may lead to over-harvesting and deforestation

<br>

By introducing property rights, we may be able to alleviate the over-harvesting issue
  - Remember that the owner still has their own interests in mind, though
  
<br>

Property rights can be especially helpful because efficient rotation cycles can be VERY long (upwards of 80 years)

<br>

Owners are less likely to cut down trees inefficiently early if they don't have to worry about others beating them to it

---

# Complications

Forest management is not as simple as we have presented thus far

<br> 

Harvesters also have to contend with

  - Wildfires, which are partially exasperated by improper forest management
  
    - Pollution
  
  - Changing climates
  
  - Societal benefits

# Complications

Forest managers may also face new incentives to *not* cut down trees

<br>

Governments are increasingly adopting carbon pricing policies that can be complemented by increased forest presence

<br>

Policies in the future may pay forest managers to now cut down some of their trees - changing the problem they solve to determine optimal rotation length
